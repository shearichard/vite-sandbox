# Vite Sandbox
This project is to allow me to try out [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) an alternative to webpack, Rollup etc. Vite allows for faster server start and restart during development and a faster initial build. The whole thing is noticeably faster than other approaches for React development.

There are [other projects](https://vitejs.dev/guide/comparisons.html) covering similar territory : [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/); [WMR](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr); [@web/dev-server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/)

There are a [number of templates](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) provided, the initial focus of Vite was Vue but React and a number of others are supported and in each case you can use a 'with Typescript' or just a plain 'no Typescript' version.

## Starting the server in this project

```
yarn dev
```
